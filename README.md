# Tarot Game (5 players)
## Introduction
Games are played with Tarot cards in various countries of Europe, but nowhere is it as popular as in France. There are clubs, tournaments (including duplicate events) and an official body, the Fédération Française de Tarot. French Tarot is also played in the French speaking parts of Canada.

## About the project
In this project I developed the Tarot game with AI that is able to play using Python.
